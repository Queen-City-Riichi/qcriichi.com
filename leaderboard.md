## Leaderboard Rules

For a game to count toward the **club leaderboard**, the following conditions must be met:
1. the game is played at a club-hosted in-person meetup (private games and online games should only count toward the friendly leaderboard).
1. all players agree **before the game starts** that the game will count toward the leaderboard
1. all players must understand the *furiten* rule (i.e., players are sufficiently skilled)

The current leaderboard season ends on 12/31/2025.
