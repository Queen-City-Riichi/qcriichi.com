# QCR Local Tournament 2025

Queen City Riichi is hosting a local Riichi Mahjong tournament in a relaxed environment! While this isn’t a tournament for beginners, it's very welcoming to newer players who understand the basics — such as **yaku** and **furiten** — even if you haven't learned how to score hands yet. Judges will take a light-touch approach to keep the atmosphere friendly and low-pressure.

- **Format**:
  - 3-hanchan qualifier, hand-shuffled.
  - 1 final hanchan for the top 4 players (by cumulative score from the qualifier), on an automatic table.
  - Final placements for the top 4 players are determined solely by the outcome of the final hanchan.
- **Time**: 12-6 PM for the qualifier ("75 min + 0" per hanchan). The final hanchan starts at 7:30 PM and is untimed.
- **Date**: Saturday, September 6th, 2025
- **Location**:
  - *Qualifier*: [Downtown Main Library (800 Vine St)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8uAAGThP4CuvhgLSA)
