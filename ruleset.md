## Major Modifications
These are the changes that commonly affect gameplay.
- [Abortive draws](https://riichi.wiki/Tochuu_ryuukyoku) are **off**.
- [Kiriage Mangan](https://riichi.wiki/Scoring_table#Kiriage_mangan) is **on**.
- [Agariyame and tenpaiyame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong#Runaway_victory) are **off**.
- [Leftover riichi bets](https://riichi.wiki/Scoring_variations#End_game_riichibou) are lost.
- South/West Extension is **off** (game ends upon rotating out of East 4/South 4).

We follow the [WRC 2025 Ruleset] for any rules specific to in-person play, including the definition of *chonbo* and dead hand under the ["lower penalties" variation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/634a7884c297a25f06589b79/t/6361370e4ecf892aae92d39a/1667315470805/WRC+Optional+Rules+2022.pdf), with the following exception:
1. *chonbo* penalty is -10 to the player's score, instead of -20.

*Chonbo* penalty is not enforced on beginners.

If we find that a player has intentionally committed *chonbo*, we will issue discretionary severe penalties, including banning the player from Queen City Riichi.

### [Uma](https://riichi.wiki/Oka_and_uma)
  - Yonma Hanchan: +16/+6/-6/-16
  - Yonma Tonpuu: +8/+3/-3/-8
  - Sanma Hanchan: +16/0/-16
  - Sanma Tonpuu: +8/0/-8

## Minor Modifications
These are very specific changes that rarely affect gameplay.

- *Renhou* is a 7-han yaku.

## Clarifications
- *Nagashi Mangan* payment will void tenpai payments. All other game progression stays unchanged (i.e., riichi sticks stay in the center, honba counter +1, dealership rotates if dealer is not tenpai).
