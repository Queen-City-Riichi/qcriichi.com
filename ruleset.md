## Major Modifications
These are changes that commonly affect gameplay.
- [Abortive draws](https://riichi.wiki/Tochuu_ryuukyoku) are **off**.
- [Kiriage Mangan](https://riichi.wiki/Scoring_table#Kiriage_mangan) is **on**.
- [Agariyame and tenpaiyame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong#Runaway_victory) are **off**.
- [Leftover riichi bets](https://riichi.wiki/Scoring_variations#End_game_riichibou) are lost.

### [Uma](https://riichi.wiki/Oka_and_uma)
  - Yonma Hanchan: +16/+6/-6/-16
  - Yonma Tonpuu: +8/+3/-3/-8
  - Sanma Hanchan: +16/0/-16
  - Sanma Tonpuu: +8/0/-8

### Chonbo/Dead Hand

We follow [WRC's definition of chonbo and dead hand](https://www.worldriichi.org/wrc-rules), except with the following changes:
1. chonbo penalty is always -10 to the player's score.
2. an empty win call without revealing the hand results in a dead hand, NOT chonbo.

Chonbo penalty is not enforced on beginners.

If we find that a player has intentionally committed chonbo, we will issue discretionary severe penalties, including banning the player from Queen City Riichi.

## Minor Modifications
These are very specific changes that rarely affect gameplay.

- Renhou is a 7-han yaku.

## Clarificatinos
- Nagashi Mangan payment will void tenpai payments. All other game progression stays unchanged (i.e., riichi sticks stay in the center, honba counter +1, dealership rotates if dealer is not tenpai).
